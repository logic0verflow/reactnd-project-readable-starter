# Readable

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Getting Started
The project relies on a server backend that is included in the repository under
`./api-server`. The Readable app resides in the `./app` folder and contains all the
source files needed.

First, obtain the entire repository either by downloading a zipped version or
by using the git clone command below...

```
git clone https://github.com/logic0verflow/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git
```

Once downloaded, continue to start the application.

In a terminal navigate to the app root at `./app` and install the packages needed
for the project via the command below....

```
npm install
```

Once all the packages have been installed, there are scripts available to run
the application in various ways, see below.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory `./app`, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the
best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.
